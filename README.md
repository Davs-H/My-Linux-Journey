# My-Linux-Journey 12.24.2020

In this section, i'm gonna documenting about my Journey in Linux/Manjaro

Day 01: Today i abandoned Windows 10, and it was not easy because that also means i have to give up some good games that only runs on Windows.
Day 02: This day, it was a totally mess, i had to switch from linux to windows to get missed database files that are needed for browser configurations and setting up my cryptowallets on Linux, now all is set up and i don't have to face Windows again.
